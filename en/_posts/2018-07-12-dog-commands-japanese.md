Last February we adopted Kuma - a Border Collie & German Shephard mix from Alabama. Kuma means bear in Japanese (can you see the resemblance?), so we thought it only appropriate to teach her commands in Japanese.

<h2>Basic Commands</h2>
- *iiko* - good girl/boy
- *dame* - no/bad
- *osuwari* - sit
- *fuse* - down
- *oide* - come
- *mate* - wait
- *yosh* - ok (often paired with mate)
- *ato* - heel (literally translation is after)
- *sagare* - back off/leave it

<h2>Other Useful Vocab</h2>
- *gohan* - food
- *mizu* - water
- *nenne* - sleep/go to bed
- *soto* - outside/want to go out?
- *sampo* - walk
- *koori* - ice (Kuma loves eating ice in the summer)

And now for a lot of cute puppy pictures.
